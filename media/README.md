How to compile a NetMatch.dat
=============================
Run CBRC.exe and allow it to add some registry keys to
your registry. The registry modification is only to allow
.cbrs files to be ran by CoolBasic resource packer.

After running the exe, you can now run the template.cbrs
file inside this folder. It creates a new NetMatch.dat
inside the parent folder (open up template.cbrs for more
info).
