<h2><a name="netmatch">NetMatch - The End</h2>
<strong>NetMatch - The End</strong> is a multiplayer online DeathMatch-game.<br>
There are weapons available with differences in characteristics: Double hand guns, a sub-machine gun (SMG), bazooka, shotgun, grenade launcher and chainsaw.<br>
You can collect extra ammo and medical kits from the field to be more efficient on the battle field.<br>
Only the pistols carry infinite ammunition.<br>
<br>
The ranking of players is based on kill/death -ratio. 
Plenty of kills and few deaths will place the player on a higher position in the statistics.<br>
<br>
In addition to human players, computer controlled AI-characters are found on the field.


<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</h2>

<h4><a name="language">Language selection</h4>
<strong>NetMatch - The End</strong> supports two in-game languages: english and finnish. The language can be selected under SETTINGS - LANGUAGE.

<h4><a name="stats">Game statistics</h4>
Statistics show the players kills, deaths and kill/death -ratio during gameplay.<br> 
The feature can be switched on or off under SETTINGS - GAME SETTINGS - SHOW STATISTICS or during gameplay by pressing the G-button.

<h4><a name="fxvolume">SFX volume</h4>
The volume of sound effects can be adjusted under SETTINGS - GAME SETTINGS - VOLUME 
or during gameplay by pressing down and holding the V-button and pressing the arrow keys up (increase volume) or down (decrease volume).

<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h2><a name="server">Server</h2>

<h4><a name="servername">Naming the server</h4>
The server needs a name so that players can identify it and join the game. 
The name can be anything you like.

<h4><a name="serverport">Port</h4>
To be able to work the server needs a port to the Internet.<br>
<br>
The port is a numeric value between 1 and 65535. However, it is recommended to use a higher value than 1024 for ports under that value may be occupied for something else.<br>
<br>
You can only have one server per port.

<h4><a name="roundtime">Match time</h4>
The length of a match must be set to a server. The time is set in minutes.<br>
If round changes are not wanted, enter zero (0) into this space. 
In this case the match will continue an unlimited time.<br>
After each match the players are ranked.

<h4><a name="map">Map selection</h4>
A map must be chosen for the server, on which the NetMatch-players play.<br>
In addition to map name a preview of the current map is seen in the selection.

<h4><a name="register">Registration and execution of the server</h4>
Registration and execution of the server make it visible for all NetMatch-players in server listing.

<h4><a name="serverstart">Execution of the server without registration</h4>
Execution without registration makes the server a hidden one, 
so it can only be joined by knowing it's IP-address and port.

<h4><a name="playingserver">Playing on a server</h4>
Please notice that a program running a server cannot be used to join a game because it's focusing all power to running the server.<br>
While the server is running the screen is blue.<br>
If the same computer that is running a server is wished to be used to join a game, another program must be launched by double clicking the game's exe-file.<br>
However, running two programs simultaneously may cause unstability in the server program, especially shown as lag.

<h4><a name="servercommands">Controlling the server in game</a></h4>
Server can be controlled by using chat commands. Commands take the form of <code>/&lt;command&gt; [parameters]</code>.<br>
Underneath you will find all of the available commands. Compulsory parameters are listed like <code>&lt;this&gt;</code><br>
and optional parameters are listed like <code>[this]</code>.<br><br>

<h4><a name="nickname">Nick</h4>
Each player needs a freely chooseable nick in order to join the game.

<h4><a name="findserver">Searching for servers</h4>
The server listing is searched for joinable NetMatch-servers.

<h4><a name="address">Address</h4>
A server can also be joined to directly, assuming it's running and e.g. unregistered. 
If so, the servers IP-address must be known (see also Port).

<h4><a name="clientport">Port</h4>
A server can also be joined to directly, assuming it's running and e.g. unregistered. 
If so, the servers port must be known (see also Address).

<h4><a name="startgame">Starting the game</h4>
When the IP-address and port are known, the server is joined directly.

<h4><a name="playing2">Playing</h4>
<strong>NetMatch - The End</strong> supports two styles of controlling the character: mouse or keyboard control.<br>
<br>
There are two options available for character control.<br>
This setting effects on how the character moves when using keys WASD.<br>
The style can be selected under SETTINGS - GAME SETTINGS - CHARACTER CONTROL.<br>
<br>
In mouse control the cursor is replaced with cross-hairs in the direction the character is facing. 
Left mouse button fires the current weapon and the right button toggles weapons. 
There's a small delay when swapping weapons. <br>
<br>
In keyboard control the character is moved and turned with ARROW KEYS. 
SPACE fires the current weapon and TAB toggles weapons, again with a small delay.<br>
<br>
Please notice that weapons can't be swapped immediately after firing but after a time the current weapon takes to reload. 
Reload time varies with each weapon. The SMG reloads quickly, the bazooka slowly.<br>
<br>
It's possible to send messages to other players during gameplay.
The messaging console comes out by pressing the C-button.
The message written to the console is sent by pressing ENTER and exiting console by pressing ESC.<br>
<br>
If you wish you can bring out meters showing the performance of the game by pressing the F-button. The first figure illustrates FPS (Frames Per Second) and the second figure illustrates speed of network traffic (updates per second).
