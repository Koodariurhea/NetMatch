NetMatch - The End
==================
<em>NetMatch</em> is a multiplayer online DeathMatch-game.
There are weapons available with differences in characteristics: Double hand guns, a sub-machine gun (SMG), bazooka, shotgun, grenade launcher and chainsaw.
You can collect extra ammo and medical kits from the field to be more efficient on the battle field.
Only the pistols carry infinite ammunition.

NetMatch also features Team DeathMatch mode where players are separated to two teams, green and red, which fight against the other.

The ranking of players is based on kill/death -ratio. Plenty of kills and few deaths will place the player on a higher position in the statistics.

In addition to human players, computer controlled AI-characters are found on the field.
